  - Who...? How did you get down here alive? Past all those... things?
  - "It doesn\u2019t matter, I imagine you have a lot of questions but save those
    for later."
  - "I could use your help\u2026 See, I have been down here trying to develop an
    antidote to turn those \u201Ccreatures\u201D back to their normal selves"
  - "but I\u2019m no soldier and I\u2019m certain leaving this room will be the end
    of me. However, you seem like you know your way around a gun."
  - There should be some samples scattered around this floor, I need them to continue
    my research.
  - They should contain the same liquid as the one in the tank right next to me...
  - "You\u2019ll likely find the samples in the office area, but the doors there
    are locked so you\u2019ll need a keycard."
  - "There\u2026 should be a spare keycard in the locker room\u2026 I think."
  - "Oh and if you need, take this gun. It won\u2019t do any good in my hands."
