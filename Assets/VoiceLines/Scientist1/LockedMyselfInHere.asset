  - "Thank god you\u2019re here, I thought I was the only one who made it."
  - I locked myself in here to avoid those crazy lizards, the facility is crawling
    with them!

    abilities\u2026 "
  - Although you might feel a bit nauseous, but that's completely normal!
  - "Here, take this keycard to access the elevator. And take this radio, I\u2019ll
    guide you through the facility!"
