  - "Who\u2026? How did you get down here alive, past all those\u2026 things?"
  - "It doesn\u2019t matter, I imagine you have a lot of questions but save them
    for later."
  - "I could use your help\u2026 You see, I have been down here trying to develop
    an antidote to turn those \u201Ccreatures\u201D back to their normal selves"
  - "But I\u2019m no soldier and I\u2019m certain leaving this room would be the
    end of me."
  - However, you seem like you know your way around a gun.
  - There should be some samples scattered around this floor, I need them to continue
    my research.
  - They should contain the same liquid as the one in the tank right next to me.
  - "You\u2019ll likely find the samples in the office area, but the doors there
    are locked so you\u2019ll need a keycard."
  - "There\u2026  should be a spare keycard in the locker room\u2026 I think."
  - "Oh and if you need it, take this gun. It\u2019s no good in my hands"
