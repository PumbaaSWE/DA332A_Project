  subtitles:
  - Ah you got them! Thank you.
  - ...
  - "Hm, no, this won\u2019t be enough. You\u2019re going to need to get more."
  - "It won\u2019t be as easy to get them this time unfortunately."
  - "In the laboratory we have a device which gathers samples from, uhm, \u201Csubjects\u201D
    automatically."
  - "This means you\u2019ll have to lure the creatures into the laboratory and dispose
    of them there."
  - "You\u2019ll know you\u2019ve found the right place when you find a room with
    a grey floor."
  - "I\u2019ll keep an eye on the cameras and tune into your radio so I can communicate
    with you when you\u2019ve found it."
  - Oh, and here's the keycard to the laboratory.
